# CodeCraftHub – Server-Side Development Project

Welcome to the final project!  
Your organization is building **CodeCraftHub**, a personalized learning platform crafted for developers.  
In this project, you are assigned to design the **server-side architecture** for the platform and implement it using **Node.js** and **MongoDB**.  

You will leverage the power of **Generative AI** to create the backend components of CodeCraftHub, turning your vision into reality with modern technologies.
